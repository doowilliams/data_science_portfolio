# Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio
Repository contain portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purpoes.
Presented in the from of Jupyter Notebooks.

Tools

* **Python**: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
* **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras

# Contents
  *  ## Machine Learning
     * [Braet cancels project: using logistic regression ](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/Breat_Cancer.ipynb): logistic regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm use to predict the probability of a target varibale. The nature of target or dependent variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes
       
     * [Iris project using k-nearest neighbours (KNN)](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/Iris%20KNN.ipynb): algorithm is a simple, supervise that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.The number of nearest neighbours to a new unknown variable that has to be predicted or classified is denoted by the symbol ‘K’.
     
     * [Iris project using Neural Network (NNs)](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/Neural_Network_Irises_.ipynb): is a network or circuit of biological neurons,or in a modern sense,an artificial neural network.
     
     * [Iris projct using K-means clustering](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/K-mean%20Iris%20(unsupervised).ipynb): is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.
     * [ TfidfVectorizer - smiple text or words detector](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/Building_a_simple_NLP_Spam_and_Harm_Dectector.ipynb): Tfidfvectorizer for text classification · Term Frequency: Number of time a word appears in a text document
     * [Olympic 100m Gold Times using Linear Regression](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/Olympic%20100m%20Gold%20Times.ipynb): is the supervised Machine Learning model in which the model finds the best fit linear line between the independent and dependent variable i.e it finds the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable.

 * # Data Analysis and Visualization (Python Programming)
  
     * [Exploratory Data Analysis - House Prices](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/Boston%20house%20prices%20Liner%20Regression.ipynb): Simple analysis of house prices including quick visualizations with correlation plots.
     * [Exploratory Data Analysis - Titanic Passenger information](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/titanic.ipynb): Simple analysis of passengers on board the Titanic answering questions with visualizations.
     * [Exploratory Data Analysis - Wine Quality](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/Wine%20Quality%20(Statistic%20-%20Visualization%20EDA).ipynb): Simple statistic - visualization on the quality of wine base no acid in the wine 
     * [Simple Linear Regression - Salary](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/Linear%20Regression-%20Finance.ipynb): Small playground to summarize and study relationships between two continuos variables.
